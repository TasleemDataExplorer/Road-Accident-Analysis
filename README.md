# Road-Accident-Analysis-SQL

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis of road accident data to understand patterns in casualties, accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and time-based trends. The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can support road safety analysis and decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed records of road accidents including:

- `Accident date and time`

- `Accident severity`

- `Number of casualties and vehicles`

- `Vehicle type`

- `Road type and surface conditions`

- `Weather and light conditions`

- `Urban vs rural classification`

- `Local authority and junction details`

## Tools Used

MySQL – data querying and analysis

Excel – initial data cleaning and preparation

## Key Analysis Performed

- Total casualties and total accidents for the current year (2022)

- Casualty distribution by accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

- Percentage contribution of each severity level

- Casualties by vehicle group (Cars, Bikes, Buses, Vans, etc.)

- Monthly comparison of current year vs previous year casualties

- Casualties by road type and road surface conditions

- Urban vs rural accident impact

- Impact of light and weather conditions on casualties

- Peak accident time analysis using time bands

- Top locations with the highest number of casualties

- Junction control impact on accident severity
